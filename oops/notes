oops - object oriented programming
oops is a paradigm / process in which 
we explain all real world entity as an object

object - collection of data (property) and behaviour


student - student ki age ->property
---------student wakes up at 7pm --> behaviour


oops vs functional programming

like c language is functional 
data and behaviour are seperated
hard to manage



oops - collection of both data and behaviour : object
easy to manage
reusability
effeiency , security etc


oops 4 pillar 
1.inheritance - reusability
2.encapsulation - data hiding
3.polymorphism
4.abstraction -security
